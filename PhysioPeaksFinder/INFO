Description:  Semi-automatic local maxima GUI finder. Finds automatically the local maxima in a signal using thresholding within two overlapping sliding windows.
              Four parameters can be adjusted {Window size, overlap size, segments, threshold}
                Window size   -> Size of the two windows (#samples)
                overlap size  -> Size of the overlaps (#samples < window size)
                segement      -> Number of segments over which to compute statistical characteristics (set to 1 for stationary signals)
                threshold     -> Linear thresholding above statistics
              The peaks that were not identified or wrongly identified can then be added/removed manually by cliking on them.
Bugs:         Some screen display will interfere with the actual click input position, making the manual selection impossible.
              The automatic finder is essentially insensitive to the threshold input.
